This site was created by Kayla Lares. It implements the idea of an e-commerce site, with features like a form, pictures, and an information page about the product being shown. While itâ€™s not 100% an e-commerce site, it follows its ideals.

Components used: For the form screen, which is what the user sees first, I used a functional component called FormScreen. This uses three form input elements that ask a user to input their First and last name, along with their email. Before clicking the submit button, the information they put in the first name field is displayed back to them.

The second screen the user sees, the picture screen, uses one functional component called picture screen and a constant called pictureShow. PictureScreen uses a flat list that accepts the image, company name, phone type and other information the user will find essential regarding the smartphones their interested in. In the second function, the type of phone and image is displayed back to the user in a card formatting.

The last screen also uses a functional component called the last screen. It calls the information from the flat list that was previously set up on the second screen to display the the company, type, specs, battery life, release date, and cost in a bigger window view for the user.
